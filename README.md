# Disease-Prediction
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is able to detect whether a patient has pneumonia, both bacterial and viral, based on an X-ray image of their chest.

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images  and 2 categories either Pneumonia or Normal.

Detecting pneumonia in an x-ray scan is a simple binary classification problem: where 0 meant normal and 1 meant pneumonia.
